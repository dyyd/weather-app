Simple application using http://wsf.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/Weather.asmx service to provide weather data for a set of USA cities.

Developed using Play Framework (https://www.playframework.com/)


Release guide:
    Run "activator dist" in shell to compile a deployable package.
    Retrieve compiled application package and deploy to server. The path is outputted from the compiling command.
    Unpack .zip package to desired directory.
    Navigate to bin/ and run "weather-app".
    Before running the application it is required to change application.conf play.crypto.secret value.
    Or the other option would be to run the server with parameter "-Dplay.crypto.secret=" with some secret.
    The server must have Java 8 installed as this was the version used during development and any previous version might produce problems.
